## Remember: When You Are Including This  Library, Before It You Must Also Include stdio.h, stdlib.h and conio.h then Mail.h.

This library has 3 Methods
1) Init();
2) fillDat();
3) SendMail();
___
### We must run *Init()* while starting the code, means at the time when you start to write down the code.
### We must always run the *fillDat()* after running *Init()* to avoid many errors.
### We must run *SendMail()* Whenever we want to send mail while executing.
